# 1. Introduction

This repository is targeted to cover the topic __Serverless full stack development guidelines
with AWS Amplify framework__. It is designed to help learners understand some basic steps to
work on the mentioned topic.

We will have comprehensive walk-through and demonstration of the process of building a React-
front-end based application with GraphQL, AppSync API, DynamoDB etc. features based back-end
generated by AWS Amplify framework from its command line tool. The purpose is to guide the
developers or learners through all the processes and generate a basic running web application.

AWS serverless services will be used to design this product’s back-end features and React will be
used for the front-end UI component.

With this single framework (AWS Amplify), even a developer having not much knowledge in AWS
resources, can leverage his existing technological know-hows and expertise and can rapidly
prototype and experiment highly scalable and robust application in incredibly less time span. The
developer can focus on the front-end UI and business logic of the project but no need to think
about database scaling, optimization, maintenance, disaster recovery etc. and also the back-end
code is mostly auto generated, so it saves time and is less prone to errors that developers make
while writing codes. There is no point in spending lot of time pondering about back-end
infrastructure and security aspects of the application because they have been taken care of by
AWS cloud service provider.

It is assumed that the learners may have:

- Programming knowledge of any language, however, React is primarily used for front-end
    UI.
- Very basic knowledge of serverless environment.
- Very basic knowledge of AWS serverless infrastructures, esp. S3, Lambda functions,
    DynamoDB, IAM, Cognito Userpool etc. as we will not need to provision them directly from
    AWS console.

# 2. Implementation

We will be talking about architecture design of the product that will be built through this step-by-
step guideline, then setting-up the required tools and creating a example project- ‘a2z-online’.


**2.1 Architecture Design**

The application ‘a2z’ is targeted to cover various online businesses in the future, however for now
its scope is related to online restaurant business. Where food menus are displayed online and
logged in users can make online order and payments, only the admin user is allowed to add or
delete food menus.

![Architecture design for the product to be created](/src/assets/Picture1.png "Architecture design for the product to be created")

Figure 1. Architecture design for the product to be created

The front-end of this application is done in React and the serverless back-end is covered with AWS
Amplify. The application is hosted in S3 bucket (Hosting s3) which is configured and enabled for
static webhosting to work. Static web hosting in S3 bucket needs very simple and basic steps that
almost removes the need for extra IT administration cost, too. With AWS Amplify, web hosting is
done so quickly and without much efforts and with few commands from terminal, however for CICD
pipelines, it is done from Amplify console directly.

Another S3 bucket, i.e., image S3, is used to store all images related to the application, such as
food or menu or ingredients related images, and so on. Since, the images are meant to be viewed
publicly, so this bucket is given public access.


In the above scenario, the front-end has AWS Amplify library installed and configured to be used
from the CLI, where the front-end app sends information through the AWS Amplify library to back-
end application, used with AWS AppSync GraphQL API, which does all the CRUD (create, read,
update, delete) operations through it queries and mutations. GraphQL uses Velocity template
language (VTL) to send queries and mutation to perform data storage, data edit in the DynamoDB.

The AppSync will invoke the serverless lambda functions which will work to detect the customer
order and make payments. Once the payment is successful, it places an order and creates records
in the DynamoDB. The entire process is very simple and concentrated on GraphQL AppSync API.


**2.2 Tools**

__Node & NPM:__ Node.js and NPM need to be installed if they are not already installed where better
compatibility for node -v should be at least 10.x and npm -v 1.x or greater.

__AWS__ Account: If you are creating AWS Account for the first time you can get free tier option for 12
months. It is recommended that create an alias account with Administrative Access or use the
account that is generated when amplify is being configured as below, but in any case, it is highly
advised to turn on MFA to secure unauthorized login.


**2.3 Creating Project (a2z-online)**

Initialize a React project

```
npx create-react-app a2z-online
```

or clone the current repo: https://github.com/khemrajneupane/a2z-
online.git.
For our purpose, it is better and easier to clone the repo and start the app.

```
git clone https://github.com/khemrajneupane/a2z-online.git
cd a2z-online
npm install

```

__AWS CLI:__ It is installed globally with the following command:

```
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

```
Once the CLI is installed, let’s configure Amplify:

```
amplify configure

```

![Amplify Configure](/src/assets/Picture2.png "Amplify Configure")

Figure 2. Amplify Configure

The closest region is a better option to choose from the lists. The username is better to keep as
meaningful or project specific as possible. In this case, the username is ‘a2z-user’ and the region is
‘eu-weast-1’.
Configuration command will ask to sign into the AWS Console

![IAM user creation with programmatic access type](/src/assets/Picture3.png "IAM user creation with programmatic access type")

Figure 3. IAM user creation with programmatic access type.

and create an IAM user with the help of Amazon IAM service which takes care of managing users,
setting permissions and so on. ‘Programmatic access’, is chosen so that our access key id and
secret access key will be enabled and we will be able to use AWS API, CLI as required in this
project.


Now we can initialize this project with AWS Amplify:
```
$ amplify init
```
This command will walk us through a number of processes to initializing amplify into our React
project and generating information. Most of the processes are asking project information from us,
however, if we don’t provide any, Amplify is intelligent enough to prepare more suitable
configuration.

![AWS Amplify initialization process](/src/assets/Picture4.png "AWS Amplify initialization process")

Figure 4. AWS Amplify initialization process

Usually, it creates a project name automatically by referring to the project directory name. Provide
suitable environment, in our case, we can provide ‘dev’ as it is the development environment. It
automatically recognizes most of the project specific information and the CLI uses this information
while running commands. So, it is important to provide right information.

For authentication method, it is possible to choose AWS access keys or AWS profile, however, we
have already set-up AWS-profile user in our local computer, so it is an easier and better option. If
we want or need, can check all our saved aws credentials in local computer in ‘.aws’ folder:

```
$ cd .aws
$ ls
```
amplify/ config credentials
```
$ vim config
```


Now, when we are asked to choose the profile, the CLI commands will display all the profile names
that we have in our ‘config’ file. We choose ‘a2z-user’. It starts adding back-end environment as
‘dev’ and start creating basic resources as below:

![Amplify CLI command triggering CloudFormation to create backend environment](/src/assets/Picture5.png "Amplify CLI command triggering CloudFormation to create backend environment")

Figure 5. Amplify CLI command triggering CloudFormation to create backend environment

Amplify will create many resources in the cloud under the hood by using the CloudFormation stack
of the AWS Cloud. In the above process, Amplify will create IAM (Identity and Access
Management) role for unauthenticated and authenticated users

![Amplify creating IAM roles for authenticated and unauthenticated users](/src/assets/Picture6.png "Amplify creating IAM roles for authenticated and unauthenticated users")

Figure 6. Amplify creating IAM roles for authenticated and unauthenticated users

along with S3 deployment bucket these resources can be checked in the CloudFormation stacks:

![CloudFormation showing resources creation in progress](/src/assets/Picture7.png "CloudFormation showing resources creation in progress")

Figure 7. CloudFormation showing resources creation in progress

After the stack formation completes the status changes as in the figure below:

![CloudFormation showing resources creation completion](/src/assets/Picture8.png "CloudFormation showing resources creation completion")

Figure 8. CloudFormation showing resources creation completion

The S3 bucket will also contain new data after the Amplify initialization completes:

![Amplify initialization creates data in S3 bucket](/src/assets/Picture9.png "Amplify initialization creates data in S3 bucket")

Figure 9. Amplify initialization creates data in S3 bucket

We did not have to create all those resources but Amplify does that for us through our CLI
commands which means a lot of time and burden of creating resources have been minimized. It
would also be possible that if we had to create them on our own, we could make redundant
resources, fail to provide suitable permissions and so on.

By now, if we check our ‘a2z-online’ project directory, we will notice that two files have been added:
one in the root level, which is ‘amplify’ and the other is ‘aws-exports.js’ which is inside the ‘src’ file.

![Amplify initialization also creates a folder containing different backend for different resources, in the project’s directory ‘A2Z-ONLINE’](/src/assets/Picture10.png "Amplify initialization also creates a folder containing different backend for different resources, in the project’s directory ‘A2Z-ONLINE’")

Figure 10. Amplify initialization also creates a folder containing different backend for different resources, in the project’s directory ‘A2Z-ONLINE’

**amplify folder**
It contains all the codes related to back-end and various configurations. The config file contains
local AWS and environment configuration related json key-value pairs, along with project
configuration information which we had provided while initializing the project earlier on.

![Automatic generation of backend config. codes after Amplify initialization](/src/assets/Picture11.png "Automatic generation of backend config. codes after Amplify initialization")

Figure 11. Automatic generation of backend config. codes after Amplify initialization

The back-end folder will contain all the GraphQL schema for AppSync API which we will create
later. It will also contain all the cloud formation .yaml files later when we command CLI for adding
more resources.

**aws-exports.js**
This file is created inside the ‘src’ folder. It will contain all the key-value pairs generated
automatically; we don’t need to modify anything there.

![Amplify generated aws-exports.js file inside src directory](/src/assets/Picture12.png "Amplify generated aws-exports.js file inside src directory")

Figure 12. Amplify generated aws-exports.js file inside src directory


**2.4 Adding Authentication**

By now, the project has been initialized and all the necessary configurations for Amplify back-end
and react front-end is completed; next up we add authentication for login, logout and signup by
using Amplify’s ready-made Cognito Userpool authentication flow.
```
$ amplify add auth
```
There are default and federated login options to choose for this configuration. There are federated
login possibilities with Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, SAML, OpenID. However, for the
purpose of this application, we go for default configuration with username, password and phone
number.

![Amplify CLI adding authentication](/src/assets/Picture13.png "Amplify CLI adding authentication")

Figure 13. Amplify CLI adding authentication

Now, to see that our authentication works, we need to push this configuration which will create the
necessary back-end in our local and provision it in the cloud.

![Amplify CLI creating backend code in the project folder, necessary for authentication](/src/assets/Picture14.png "Amplify CLI creating backend code in the project folder, necessary for authentication")

Figure 14. Amplify CLI creating backend code in the project folder, necessary for authentication

```
$ amplify push
```
This process will create many resources in the cloud. It will automatically create SNSRoles,
Cognito UserPool and lambda functions which we don’t require to do manually.
− CREATE_COMPLETE SNSRole AWS::IAM::Role Sun Oct 24 2021 15:42:3\ Updating
resources in the cloud. This may take a few minutes...

− CREATE_IN_PROGRESS UserPool AWS::Cognito::UserPool Sun Oct 24
− / Updating resources in the cloud. This may take a few minutes...

− CREATE_IN_PROGRESS UserPoolClientLambda AWS::Lambda::Function...

Then we make few imports and code changes in the front-end code in order to make the
authentication form appear in the UI from where we can perform login, logout, signup operations.

![React front-end importing from 'aws-export' file to configure and use different AWS resources](/src/assets/Picture15.png "React front-end importing from 'aws-export' file to configure and use different AWS resource")

Figure 15. React front-end importing from ‘aws-export’ file to configure and use different AWS
resources

After importing config from ‘aws-exports’ file which was created when amplify was initialized, now
we can add authentication to any component in our app. For now, let’s add it to one of the
components as:

![Using AmplifyAuthenticator and AmplifySignOut components in the React project](/src/assets/Picture16.png "Using AmplifyAuthenticator and AmplifySignOut components in the React project")

Figure 16. Using AmplifyAuthenticator and AmplifySignOut components in the React project

Then let’s run the app with ‘npm start’; we can see the login form:

![Ready-to-use login UI created with Amplify authenticator](/src/assets/Picture17.png "Ready-to-use login UI created with Amplify authenticator")

Figure 17. Ready-to-use login UI created with Amplify authenticator

Since there is not any user registered in the Cognito UserPool, so we can create new account from
the link and verify it with phone number or email then it will be registered like so:

![AWS Cognito UserPool registering new user](/src/assets/Picture18.png "AWS Cognito UserPool registering new user")

Figure 18. AWS Cognito UserPool registering new user


**2.5 Creating S3 bucket**

We need to store all our project and dish images or any other images.
```
$ amplify add storage
```
With this command, we will create s3 bucket to save our images. This bucket should be accessible
for both guest and authenticated users. Even the users who are not logged in should be able to
view the images or menus in the application. This bucket should store content types as images,
audios, videos etc. For the purpose of this project, we have given this bucket a friendly name as
‘DishImages’. Since, every bucket should have a unique name, so we accept the default name.
The authenticated user should be able to perform CRUD operations, but the guest users can only
read. In order to choose between options for the authenticated user (a member of admin group in
the Cognito user pool), we can press the space tab that will put asterisk for the options.
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the
project: s33bb
? Please provide bucket name: (a2zonline040ed514085a48aeaf9f4644b734a20d)
C:\Users\Babita\Desktop\a2z-online>amplify add storage
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the
project: DishImages
? Please provide bucket name: a2zonline14fee81cb4804213bd3e9f0674947f5d
? Who should have access: Auth and guest users
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users? create/update, read, delete
? What kind of access do you want for Guest users? read
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket? No


**2.6 Adding lambda functions**

In our application, the lambda functions are required when dish order and dish payments are
made. The user will press order button then two things will happen- the product order is registered,
and payment is made, so we will create ‘paymentLambda’ and ‘orderLambda’ functions that work
as pipeline resolvers in AppSync.

```
$ amplify add function
```
With the above command, we first create:

- ‘paymentLambda’ function, as serverless function capability
- NodeJS as runtime
- Default ‘Hello World’ template
- Choose more configuration and lambda function editing as ‘no’ because we want to do so
    later.


We will perform above process the same way for ‘orderLambda’ function, too. The above process
will automatically create lambda functions inside <project-dir>/amplify/back-
end/function/paymentLambda/src.

![Amplify add function CLI command creating basic Lambda function](/src/assets/Picture19.png "Amplify add function CLI command creating basic Lambda function")

Figure 19. Amplify add function CLI command creating basic Lambda function

This lambda handler simply returns HTTP status code 200 and string ‘Hello from Lambda!’. Good
thing about this amplify is also that we can mock or test this function locally without creating
resources in the cloud as:

```
$ amplify mock function paymentLambda
```

![Amplify mocking Lambda function](/src/assets/Picture20.png "Amplify mocking Lambda function")

Figure 20. Amplify mocking Lambda function

or ```$ amplify invoke paymentLambda``` however, this version of amplify command is deprecated but
still outputs the results.

Now that the 'paymentLambda' function is created, we can replace its code with the ready-made one which is in: ```/src/amplify/function/paymentLambda/index.js```

We still need one more 'orderLambda' function, so we can follow the same procedures as above but the ready-made code is in: ```/src/amplify/function/orderLambda/index.js```

**2.7 GraphQL API**

We are going to create GraphQL API so that the front end will use this API to request data from
cloud resources, through AppSync. With GraphQL, we will device required queries to handle exact
data with AppSync in online and offline scenarios.

```
$ amplify add api
```

![Amplify adding GraphQL API](/src/assets/Picture21.png "Amplify adding GraphQL API")

Figure 21. Amplify adding GraphQL API

With the above configuration, we have created GraphQL API named ‘a2zonline’ with simple
schema template for ‘single object’ which will be used to create our own schema for thig project.
Here, we have chosen default authorization type to be Amazon Cognito User Pool, that will help to
identity our logged in user, however, we will require API keys based usages because not logged in
users should also be able to use our application in limited manners. In the above configuration, we
missed to add API keys as authorization type so, we are going to update this API:

```
$ amplify update api
```
With this command, we have options to either ‘Walkthrough all configurations’ or reset
authorization types only. In this case, we have chosen to walkthrough all configs, as follow:

![Amplify CLI command updating API configuration](/src/assets/Picture22.png "Amplify CLI command updating API configuration")

Figure 22. Amplify CLI command updating API configuration

Finally, if we check into amplify/backend folder, we will see api/a2zonline with the following basic
schema template:

![Basic GraphQL schema](/src/assets/Picture23.png "Basic GraphQL schema")

Figure 23. Basic GraphQL schema

However, in order to save time, we replace this default ```schema.graphql``` with ready-made code that is in: ```src/amplify/backend/api/a2zonline/schema.graphql``` folder.

**2.8 Mock API**

As a good practice, it is better to run the mock test of the GraphQL API before we actually deploy
or push to cloud for resources creation. So, we can save our resources without having to run them
into our billable account. Running the mock version will allow us to test the API locally by running
local graphical editor on a certain port. In order to perform the CRUD operations, it will use SQLite
in-memory-database.

```
$ amplify mock api
```

![Configuring for Amplify GraphQL API mocking](/src/assets/Picture24.png "Configuring for Amplify GraphQL API mocking")

Figure 24. Configuring for Amplify GraphQL API mocking

We have configured the mock environment as above and choosen language, queries, mutation
and subscription file location with simple nesting. The GraphQL editor will be running in
[http://localhost:20002/](http://localhost:20002/) where we can perform all sorts of GraphQL operations for testing purposes.

![GraphQL mocking in localhost](/src/assets/Picture25.png "GraphQL mocking in localhost")

Figure 25. GraphQL mocking in [http://localhost:](http://localhost:)


In order to run this mock environment, the above command will create local resources in our
project: inside src/graphql, it creates all the required mutaions, quiries and subscription files along
with adding GraphQL endpoint in the aws-exports.js file.

**2.9 GraphQL Schema**

We create GraphQL Schema to define our application’s data model and enhance it by adding
GraphQL directives to perform more actions. Out of 9 different kinds of directives, we will be using
only the following which are defined in the Amplify documentation as following (Amplify Docs,
Directives, 2021):

- @model : Defines top level object types in your API that are backed by Amazon DynamoDB
- @auth: Defines authorization rules for your @model types and fields
- @connection: Defines 1:1, 1:M and N:M relationships between @model types
- @function: Configures a Lambda function resolver for a field
- @key Configures custom index structures for @model types.

We will create 4 types of schemas as ‘Dish’,’ DishOrder’, ‘Order’ and custom mutation type
‘processOrder’:

**2.9.1 Type Dish**

![The GraphQL schema ‘Dish’ type](/src/assets/Picture26.png "The GraphQL schema ‘Dish’ type")

Figure 26. The GraphQL schema ‘Dish’ type

In the above schema, the @auth directive contains many rules handled by Cognito User Pool:


- The admin or the users who belong to the ‘Admin’ group, has the full authority to perform
    CRUD operations on the Dish type.
- All the authenticated users have read rights on the Dish type and
- All the public users (not logged in) can have read access.
Likewise, @model directive is used to create tables for Dish type in the DynamoDB and create
Velocity Template File that handles CRUD operations. Again, we are not allowing real-time
updates yet, so subscription is set to null.

**2.9.2 Type Order**

This is the second main schema after Dish. It contains user info., ordered dish, date, price and id.
The auth rules implied:

- The admin or the users who belongs to the ‘Admin’ group has every rights
- The logged in user (identified user) can read his own orders only. The users logged in are
    identified with their registered emails in this case.

![The GraphQL schema ‘Order’ type](/src/assets/Picture27.png "The GraphQL schema ‘Order’ type")

Figure 27. The GraphQL schema ‘Order’ type

We also add @key directive to identify the user who makes the order and also it refers to the ‘user’
fields to make search on this particular order.


**2.9.3 Type Mutation**

This is custom mutation type that is required to execute 2 lambda functions: ‘paymentLambda’ and
‘orderLambda’ and also to contain order fields. When the user selects the dishes, puts them in the
basket and sets to checkout, the user’s cart items, price, token from payment platform (Stripe in
our case), address etc. are checked in the make order process and for successful and
unsuccessful payments, it creates the status of ‘DONE’ or ‘FAILED’:

![GraphQL custom ’Mutation’ type](/src/assets/Picture28.png "GraphQL custom ’Mutation’ type")

Figure 28. GraphQL custom ’Mutation’ type

‘paymentLambda’ function will be executed and once the payment is successful, it will invoke
‘orderLambda’ and keeps the records in the DynamoDB.
In other words, when paymentLambda function executes first, it does two things:

- Sends the order charging bill information to Stripe as:

```
await stripe.charges.create({
amount: total,
currency: "eur",
source: token,
description: `Order ${new Date()} by user: ${email}`
});

````

- And returns the following fields:
- return { id, cart, total, address, username, email };
While the orderLambda function will receive the above return values as:
const payload = event.prev.result;
From this payload, it will extract the details to register the order in OrderTable and also in
DishOrder bridge table.


**2.9.4 Type DishOrder**

This is a N:M (many-to-many) relationship scenario where every order for dishes is presented in
this third table. This type is required because a user can have many orders for many dishes.

![GraphQL custom DishOrder type to create bridge table](/src/assets/Picture29.png "GraphQL custom DishOrder type to create bridge table")

Figure 29. GraphQL custom DishOrder type to create bridge table

When an order is made, we need this table to keep the record of the orders and dish by their ids.
This is a bridge table which is referred in Dish type and Order type as:

```
orders: [DishOrder] @connection(keyName: "byDish", fields: ["id"])
dishes: [DishOrder] @connection(keyName: "byOrder", fields: ["id"])
```

Likewise, secondary indexes ‘byDish’ and ‘byOrder’ are used to get all dishes and orders.
When we check the status as ‘ _amplify status’_ CLI command, we will get a table of all the
categories, resource names, operation which helps us to understand which resources have been
created, updated, deleted etc. Now that most of our resources have been created, we can finally
push it to the cloud.

```
$ amplify push
```
Since we last created GraphQL API, we have not pushed the code to cloud so now, it will
automatically crate ‘graphql’ folder inside ‘src’ folder that contains all GraphQL mutation.js,
queries.js and schema.json files along with the greatest number of other resources in the cloud.
When the process finishes, we can look into the aws-exports.js file and see that it has created a lot
of key-values json object some of which will be used in the project later.

# **3. Environment variables**

Some secret keys and ids require them to be used in a secured place. We don’t’ want to show them in the code as they can be visible in the GitHub code repo, which can cause some vulnerabilities. The best way to set those secrets are to put them in the environment variables of lambda functions.

```
const ORDER_TABLE = process.env.ORDER_TABLE; 
const DISH_ORDER_TABLE = process.env.DISH_ORDER_TABLE;
const USER_POOL_ID = process.env.USER_POOL_ID;
const stripe = require("stripe")(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET);
```
![Putting secrets to environment variables in lambda functions](/src/assets/Picture301.png "Dish creation not authorized example")

Figure 30. Dish creation not authorized example

# **4. React front-end**

In this section, we will delve deep into the front-end part of the React project to understand how the
CRUD operations are being called from different components.


**4.1 Submitting food menu from admin page:**

Admin page is designed to create dish entries in the database. This page requires login as admin
because we have used AmplifyAuthenticator component imported from aws-amplify/ui-react. Any
page that requires authentication can be used with this UI component. If the not logged in user
tries to access that page, will be shown the built-in login form.
With the following GraphQL function we create dish object:

```
const dishDetails = ({ name: name, description: description, image: image, price:
price, special_today:special_today });
await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(createDish, { input: dishDetails }));
```

AWS Amplify library can be imported to call the API to perform GraphQL operations to createDish
mutation type.
Since, only the user from Admin group is authorized to perform CRUD operation on foodmenu,
hence when we test submitting foodmenu as a normal logged in user, we get the following error:

![Dish creation not authorized example](/src/assets/Picture30.png "Dish creation not authorized example")

Figure 30. Dish creation not authorized example

From amplify console, we need to add this normal user to the Admin group. In our case, we have
‘testuser’ as user member of Admin group.

![Adding the user to Admin group to enable dish creation](/src/assets/Picture31.png "Adding the user to Admin group to enable dish creation")

Figure 31. Adding the user to Admin group to enable dish creation

Since we have added the user to the Admin group, we can add new foodmenu item from admin
page. This time, the item is saved in DynamoDB and also in S3 bucket.

![Item created in DynamoDB by the user member of Admin group](/src/assets/Picture32.png "Item created in DynamoDB by the user member of Admin group")

Figure 32. Item created in DynamoDB by the user member of Admin group

In S3 bucket, the admin created item is located in:

![Item created in S3 bucket by the user member of Admin group](/src/assets/Picture33.png "Item created in S3 bucket by the user member of Admin group")

Figure 33. Item created in S3 bucket by the user member of Admin group

However, this directory has no public access:

![No public access](/src/assets/Picture340.png "No public access")
So, we can edit the bucket policy and allow public access to images folder:

![Policy creating public access to the S3 bucket](/src/assets/Picture34.png "Policy creating public access to the S3 bucket")

Figure 34. Policy creating public access to the S3 bucket

After the access rights are fixed, we can easily view them in the React front-end home page:

![React front-end UI view, after the images are added in S3 and given public access
policy](/src/assets/Picture35.png "React front-end UI view, after the images are added in S3 and given public access
policy")

Figure 35. React front-end UI view, after the images are added in S3 and given public access
policy

We can now select items and put them into cart. However, payment part is still not final. At this
stage, if we try hitting payment button, we will get the following errors:

![Stripe payment error example](/src/assets/Picture36.png "Stripe payment error example")

Figure 36. Stripe payment error example

This is because we still need to import stripe into this file:
a2z-online/amplify/backend/function/paymentLambda/src
We still see the error in console that clarifies that our function ‘paymentLambda’ has no permission
to perform Cognito AdminGetUser. Hence, we can allow this function to access Cognito users.
From amplify console, we can go to functions and choose paymentLambda and view in lambda.

![Configuring ’paymentLambda’ function to perform Cognito AdminGetUser](/src/assets/Picture37.png "Configuring ’paymentLambda’ function to perform Cognito AdminGetUser")

Figure 37. Configuring ’paymentLambda’ function to perform Cognito AdminGetUser

From Configuration tab, choose Permission, which will show you the function execution role name.
Follow this name link which will open in IAM console where we need to add inline policy for
Cognito User Pool.

![The process or adding Cognito User Pool permission to Lambda function](/src/assets/Picture38.png "The process or adding Cognito User Pool permission to Lambda function")

Figure 38. The process or adding Cognito User Pool permission to Lambda function

We need to select reading access levels for ‘AdminGetUser’.
Likewise, we have ‘orderLambda’ function that needs to have access to the DynamoDB. Hence,
we can attach one more IAM policy to this function with DynamoDB full access.

**4.2 Cart**

Items can be picked from home page or all dishes page and added to the cart for payment. The
cart is an array that contains cart items as:

```
const cartItems = [...cart, { id, title, image, price, amount: 1 }];
```

The cart contains checkout form component which accepts the orderdetails containing token. If the
token is present, then the react useEffect hook executes the checkout function.

```
useEffect(() => {
if (orderDetails.token) {
checkout(orderDetails);
clearCart();
history.push("/");
}
}, [checkout, clearCart, history, orderDetails]);
```

**4.3 Stripe Payment:**

Stripe payment is very easy to integrate into React and Node project with its simple-to-use API and
rich documentation. It has free test mode that is so useful to test the payment and transaction
without having to make real bank transactions. We can create a free demo account and start using
its public and secret keys.

The project follows stripe setup and code templates from the stripe documentation that can be
followed herein:
https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment-charges?platform=web#add-stripe.js-and-elements-to-your-page.
In this project, we have used CardElement imported from react-stripe library to build the payment
form with some custom styles and error messages. The Checkout component is responsible for
sending the order details to the stripe dashboard. Stripe element is wrapped inside the


AmplifyAuthenticator component so that the logged in user can make this order. The Elements
provider allows you to use Element components and access the Stripe object. To use Elements
provider, call loadStripe from @stripe/stripd-js with your publishable key. The loadStripe function
asynchronously loads the Stripe.js script and initializes a Stripe object. (Stripe docs, 2022)

```
const stripeKey= process.env.REACT_APP_STRIPE_KEY;
const stripePromise = loadStripe(stripeKey);
<AmplifyAuthenticator>
<Elements stripe={stripePromise}>
<section>
<h2>Checkout Now</h2>
<CheckoutForm />
</section>
</Elements>
</AmplifyAuthenticator>

````

Once the payment is successful, we can log in to the stripe dashboard and make sure it is
registered there.

**5. Conclusion:**

As there are a number of serverless services to choose from however, Amplify, being a framework designed especially with full compatibility with AWS cloud to quickly prototyping and creating MVP instantly, AWS and Amplify go together.

AWS also offers pay-per-use billing system, free-tier offers, and easy integration of serverless services.The serverless full stack development, by using AWS Amplify, along with related AWS resources, is a better choice to meet the business constraints of small and  startup IT companies. Another benefit is that using Amplify framework to create serverless backend infrastructures in AWS can be done easily and anyone who is just a basic user of AWS cloud can significantly contribute to creating it. 

The AWS Amplify is suitable for serverless full stack development, which takes care of creating all the required resources like- storage, API, serverless lambda functions and the hassle-free deployment in the cloud, just by using its related CLI commands. Installation of required tools are also very easy and straightforward and the cost of creating an account using AWS resources are mostly free of cost for the free-tier account that remains valid for a year.

This project work as a guideline or guiding resource for any companies or even individual developers to learn the way to create a full-stack web application backed by React JS in the front-end and AWS Amplify generated GraphQL API in the back-end connected to the DynamoDB, S3 buckets along with the role of Cognito User pool for user management, IAM roles etc.

Ultimately, application development walkthrough or guidelines develops into a fully working application. This repository contains all the step-by-step guidelines from the scratch to the finish. Upon following this guidelines, the user will be able to create a basic functioning restaurant app in serverless full-stack environment.

**Happy Amplifying !**
